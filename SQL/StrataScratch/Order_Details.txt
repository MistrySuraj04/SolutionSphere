Order records based on the customer id in ascending order.

### Table Structure

Tables: customers, orders

customers :

id:              int
first_name:      varchar
last_name:       varchar
city:            varchar
address:         varchar
phone_number:    varchar

id:                  int
cust_id:            int
order_date:         datetime
order_details:      varchar
total_order_cost:   int

### Solution Query

SELECT c.first_name, o.order_date, o.order_details, o.total_order_cost
FROM customers as c
JOIN orders as o
    ON c.id = o.cust_id
WHERE first_name IN ('EVA', 'JILL')
ORDER BY c.id ASC;

### Explanation

- **Purpose**: Retrieves order information for customers named 'EVA' and 'JILL', including their first names, order dates, order details, and total order costs.
- **Selected Columns**:
  - `c.first_name`: Selects the first name of the customer.
  - `o.order_date`: Selects the date when the order was placed.
  - `o.order_details`: Selects the details of the order.
  - `o.total_order_cost`: Selects the total cost of the order.
- **Data Source**:
  - `FROM customers AS c`: Pulls data from the `customers` table and aliases it as `c`.
  - `JOIN orders AS o ON c.id = o.cust_id`: Performs an inner join with the `orders` table (aliased as `o`) based on matching `id` from the `customers` table and `cust_id` from the `orders` table. This ensures that only customers with associated orders are included.
- **Filtering**:
  - `WHERE first_name IN ('EVA', 'JILL')`: Filters the results to include only those records where the customer's first name is either 'EVA' or 'JILL'.
- **Ordering**:
  - `ORDER BY c.id ASC`: Sorts the results in ascending order based on the customer ID (`c.id`).
