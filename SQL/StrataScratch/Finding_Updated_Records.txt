# Question 10299: Finding Updated Records

**Platform:** StrataScratch

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Problem Statement**

We have a table with employees and their salaries, however, some of the records are old and contain outdated salary information.
Find the current salary of each employee assuming that salaries increase each year.
Output their id, first name, last name, department ID, and current salary.
Order your list by employee ID in ascending order.

### Table Structure

Table: ms_employee_salary

id:             INT
first_name:     VARCHAR
last_name:      VARCHAR
salary:         INT
department_id:  INT

### Solution Query

SELECT id, first_name, last_name, department_id, MAX(salary)
FROM ms_employee_salary
GROUP BY id, first_name, last_name, department_id
ORDER BY id ASC;

### Explanation

- **Purpose**: Retrieves the employee details along with the maximum salary for each employee from the `ms_employee_salary` table, ordered by employee ID.
- **Selected Columns**:
  - `id`: Selects the unique identifier of the employee.
  - `first_name`: Selects the first name of the employee.
  - `last_name`: Selects the last name of the employee.
  - `department_id`: Selects the department ID where the employee works.
  - `MAX(salary)`: Retrieves the maximum salary for each employee.
- **Data Source**:
  - `FROM ms_employee_salary`: Pulls data from the `ms_employee_salary` table.
- **Grouping**:
  - `GROUP BY id, first_name, last_name, department_id`: Groups the results by the employee’s ID, first name, last name, and department ID, ensuring that the maximum salary is calculated per employee.
- **Ordering**:
  - `ORDER BY id ASC`: Sorts the results in ascending order based on the employee ID (`id`), so the employees are displayed in order of their IDs.

**Note**: This query might work in databases like MySQL where all non-aggregated columns must be listed in the `GROUP BY` clause. However, in some other databases (like PostgreSQL or SQL Server),
`MAX(salary)` might not work properly unless it’s within a subquery or window function.
