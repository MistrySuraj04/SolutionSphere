### Explanation

- **Purpose**: Counts the number of occurrences of songs for each artist in the Spotify worldwide daily song ranking dataset.
- **Selected Columns**:
  - `artist`: Selects the name of the artist.
  - `COUNT(id) AS n_occurences`: Counts the number of song entries (using `id`) for each artist and labels the count as `n_occurences`.
- **Data Source**:
  - `FROM spotify_worldwide_daily_song_ranking`: Pulls data from the `spotify_worldwide_daily_song_ranking` table.
- **Grouping**:
  - `GROUP BY artist`: Groups the results by `artist`, allowing the count of occurrences to be calculated for each artist.
- **Ordering**:
  - `ORDER BY 2 DESC`: Sorts the results in descending order based on the second selected column, which is the count of occurrences (`n_occurences`). This means that artists with the highest number of song occurrences will appear first.
