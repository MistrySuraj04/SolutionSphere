**Problem Statement**

Find all Lyft drivers who earn either equal to or less than 30k USD or equal to or more than 70k USD.
Output all details related to retrieved records.

### Table Structure

Table: lyft_drivers

index:          int
start_date:     datetime
end_date:       datetime
yearly_salary:  int

### Solution Query

SELECT *
FROM lyft_drivers
WHERE ( yearly_salary <= 30000 ) OR ( yearly_salary >= 70000 );

### Explanation

- **Purpose**: Retrieves all records of Lyft drivers whose yearly salary is either below or equal to $30,000 or above or equal to $70,000.
- **Selected Columns**:
  - `*`: Selects all columns from the `lyft_drivers` table.
- **Data Source**:
  - `FROM lyft_drivers`: Pulls data from the `lyft_drivers` table.
- **Filtering**:
  - `WHERE (yearly_salary <= 30000) OR (yearly_salary >= 70000)`: Filters the results to include only those records where the `yearly_salary` is either less than or equal to $30,000 or greater than or equal to $70,000. This condition allows for the selection of drivers with either low or high annual salaries, excluding those with salaries in the range between $30,001 and $69,999.
