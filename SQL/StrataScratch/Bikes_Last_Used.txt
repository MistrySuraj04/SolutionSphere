# Question 10176: Bikes Last Used

**Platform:** StrataScratch

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Problem Statement**


Find the last time each bike was in use.
Output both the bike number and the date-timestamp of the bike's last use
(i.e., the date-time the bike was returned). Order the results by bikes that were most recently used.

### Table Structure

Table: dc_bikeshare_q1_2012

duration:             VARCHAR
duration_seconds:     INT
start_time:           DATETIME
start_station:        VARCHAR
start_terminal:       INT
end_time:             DATETIME
end_station:          VARCHAR
end_terminal:         INT
bike_number:          VARCHAR
rider_type:           VARCHAR
id:                   INT

### Solution Query

SELECT bike_number, end_time
FROM dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
GROUP BY bike_number
ORDER BY end_time DESC;

### Explanation

- **Purpose**: Retrieves the bike numbers and their latest end times from the DC Bikeshare dataset, sorted by the most recent `end_time`.
- **Selected Columns**:
  - `bike_number`: Selects the unique identifier for each bike.
  - `end_time`: Selects the end time of the bike trips.
- **Data Source**:
  - `FROM dc_bikeshare_q1_2012`: Pulls data from the `dc_bikeshare_q1_2012` table.
- **Grouping**:
  - `GROUP BY bike_number`: Groups the results by `bike_number`, ensuring only one entry per bike is selected.
- **Ordering**:
  - `ORDER BY end_time DESC`: Sorts the results by `end_time` in descending order, showing the most recent bike trips first.

Note: Since `end_time` is used in the `ORDER BY` clause but is not aggregated, this query might result in an error in some SQL databases due to improper grouping.
In such cases, you might need to apply an aggregation function like `MAX(end_time)` instead.
