# Question 10087: Find all posts which were reacted to with a heart

**Platform:** StrataScratch

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Problem Statement**

Find all posts which were reacted to with a heart. For such posts output all columns from facebook_posts table.

### Table Structure

Tables: facebook_reactions, facebook_posts

poster:        int
friend:        int
reaction:      varchar
date_day:      int
post_id:       int

### Solution Query

SELECT DISTINCT POSTS.*
FROM facebook_reactions AS REACTIONS
JOIN facebook_posts AS POSTS ON REACTIONS.post_id = POSTS.post_id
WHERE reaction = 'heart';

### Explanation

- **Purpose**: Retrieves distinct records of Facebook posts that have received a 'heart' reaction.
- **Selected Columns**:
  - `POSTS.*`: Selects all columns from the `facebook_posts` table.
- **Data Source**:
  - `FROM facebook_reactions AS REACTIONS`: Pulls data from the `facebook_reactions` table and aliases it as `REACTIONS`.
  - `JOIN facebook_posts AS POSTS ON REACTIONS.post_id = POSTS.post_id`: Performs an inner join with the `facebook_posts` table (aliased as `POSTS`) based on the matching `post_id` between the two tables.
- **Filtering**:
  - `WHERE reaction = 'heart'`: Filters the results to include only those posts that have received a reaction labeled as 'heart'.
- **Distinct Selection**:
  - `SELECT DISTINCT`: Ensures that only unique post records are returned, removing any duplicates that may arise from multiple heart reactions on the same post.
