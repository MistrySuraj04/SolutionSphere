**Platform:** StrataScratch

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Problem Statement**

Find the number of employees working in the Admin department that joined in April or later.

### Table Structure

Table: worker

worker_id:        int
first_name:      varchar
last_name:       varchar
salary:          int
joining_date:    datetime
department:      varchar

### Solution Query

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT WORKER_ID)
FROM worker
WHERE DEPARTMENT = 'ADMIN' AND MONTH(JOINING_DATE) >= '4';

### Explanation

- **Purpose**: Counts the number of distinct workers in the 'ADMIN' department who joined in April or later.
- **Selected Column**:
  - `COUNT(DISTINCT WORKER_ID)`: Counts the unique `WORKER_ID`s, ensuring that each worker is only counted once.
- **Data Source**: The data is pulled from the `worker` table.
- **Filtering**:
  - `WHERE DEPARTMENT = 'ADMIN'`: Filters the results to include only workers in the 'ADMIN' department.
  - `AND MONTH(JOINING_DATE) >  = '4'`: Further filters the results to include only those whose `JOINING_DATE` falls in April (month 4) or later.
