**Platform:** StrataScratch

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Problem Statement**

Find the number of workers by department who joined in or after April.
Output the department name along with the corresponding number of workers.
Sort records based on the number of workers in descending order.

### Table Structure

Table: worker

worker_id:        int
first_name:      varchar
last_name:       varchar
salary:          int
joining_date:    datetime
department:      varchar

### Solution Query

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT WORKER_ID), DEPARTMENT
FROM worker
WHERE MONTH(JOINING_DATE) >= '4'
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT
ORDER BY 1 DESC;

### Explanation

- **Purpose**: Counts the number of distinct workers who joined in April or later, grouped by department.
- **Selected Columns**:
  - `COUNT(DISTINCT WORKER_ID)`: Counts the unique `WORKER_ID`s to ensure each worker is only counted once.
  - `DEPARTMENT`: Selects the department to which the workers belong.
- **Data Source**: The data is pulled from the `worker` table.
- **Filtering**:
  - `WHERE MONTH(JOINING_DATE) >= '4'`: Filters the results to include only those workers whose `JOINING_DATE` is in April (month 4) or later.
- **Grouping**:
  - `GROUP BY DEPARTMENT`: Groups the results by the `DEPARTMENT`, allowing the count of distinct workers to be calculated for each department.
- **Ordering**:
  - `ORDER BY 1 DESC`: Sorts the results in descending order based on the first selected column, which is the count of distinct workers.
