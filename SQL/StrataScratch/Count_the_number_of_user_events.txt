# Question 9653: Count the number of user events performed by MacBookPro users

**Platform:** StrataScratch

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Problem Statement**

Count the number of user events performed by MacBookPro users.
Output the result along with the event name.
Sort the result based on the event count in the descending order.

### Table Structure

Table: playbook_events

user_id:       int
occurred_at:   datetime
event_type:    varchar
event_name:    varchar
location:      varchar
device:        varchar

### Solution Query

SELECT event_name, COUNT(user_id)
FROM playbook_events
WHERE device = 'macbook pro'
GROUP BY event_name
ORDER BY COUNT(user_id) DESC;

### Explanation

- **Purpose**: Counts the number of users for each event associated with the device type 'MacBook Pro'.
- **Selected Columns**:
  - `event_name`: Selects the name of the event.
  - `COUNT(user_id)`: Counts the total number of unique users (`user_id`) associated with each event.
- **Data Source**: The data is pulled from the `playbook_events` table.
- **Filtering**:
  - `WHERE device = 'macbook pro'`: Filters the results to include only events recorded on 'MacBook Pro' devices.
- **Grouping**:
  - `GROUP BY event_name`: Groups the results by `event_name`, allowing the count of users to be calculated for each event.
- **Ordering**:
  - `ORDER BY COUNT(user_id) DESC`: Sorts the results in descending order based on the count of users, so events with the highest user counts appear first.
