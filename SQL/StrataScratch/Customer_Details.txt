**Platform:** StrataScratch

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Problem Statement**

Find the details of each customer regardless of whether the customer made an order. Output the customer's first name, last name, and the city along with the order details.
Sort records based on the customer's first name and the order details in ascending order.

### Table Structure

Tables: customers, orders

customers :

id:              int
first_name:      varchar
last_name:       varchar
city:            varchar
address:         varchar
phone_number:    varchar

orders :

id:                  int
cust_id:            int
order_date:         datetime
order_details:      varchar
total_order_cost:   int

### Solution Query

SELECT
    c.first_name as first_name,
    c.last_name as last_name,
    c.city as city,
    o.order_details as order_details
FROM customers as c
LEFT JOIN orders as o
    on c.id = o.cust_id
ORDER BY c.first_name, c.last_name, o.order_details;

### Explanation

- **Purpose**: Retrieves customer names, their city, and corresponding order details from the customers and orders tables.
- **Selected Columns**:
  - `c.first_name AS first_name`: Selects the customer's first name and labels it as `first_name`.
  - `c.last_name AS last_name`: Selects the customer's last name and labels it as `last_name`.
  - `c.city AS city`: Selects the customer's city and labels it as `city`.
  - `o.order_details AS order_details`: Selects the order details and labels it as `order_details`.
- **Data Source**:
  - `FROM customers AS c`: Pulls data from the `customers` table and aliases it as `c`.
  - `LEFT JOIN orders AS o ON c.id = o.cust_id`: Performs a left join with the `orders` table (aliased as `o`) based on the matching `id` from the `customers` table and `cust_id` from the `orders` table. This ensures that all customers are included, even if they have no associated orders.
- **Ordering**:
  - `ORDER BY c.first_name, c.last_name, o.order_details`: Sorts the results first by the customer's first name, then by last name, and finally by order details.
