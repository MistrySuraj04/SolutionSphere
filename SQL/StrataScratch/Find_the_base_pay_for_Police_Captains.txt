### Explanation

- **Purpose**: Retrieves the names and base pay of employees whose job titles include the term 'CAPTAIN'.
- **Selected Columns**:
  - `employeename`: Selects the name of the employee.
  - `basepay`: Selects the base pay of the employee.
- **Data Source**:
  - `FROM sf_public_salaries`: Pulls data from the `sf_public_salaries` table.
- **Filtering**:
  - `WHERE jobtitle LIKE '%CAPTAIN%'`: Filters the results to include only those records where the `jobtitle` contains the substring 'CAPTAIN'. The use of the wildcard `%` before and after 'CAPTAIN' allows for matching job titles that have additional characters before or after the word.
