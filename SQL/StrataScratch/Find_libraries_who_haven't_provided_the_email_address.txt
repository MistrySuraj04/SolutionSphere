### Solution Query

SELECT DISTINCT home_library_code
FROM library_usage
WHERE notice_preference_definition = 'email'
    AND provided_email_address = FALSE;

### Explanation

- **Purpose**: Retrieves a list of unique home library codes from the library usage records where specific email conditions are met.
- **Selected Column**:
  - `DISTINCT home_library_code`: Selects unique `home_library_code` values, ensuring that each code appears only once in the result set.
- **Data Source**:
  - `FROM library_usage`: Pulls data from the `library_usage` table.
- **Filtering**:
  - `WHERE notice_preference_definition = 'email'`: Filters the results to include only those records where the notice preference is set to 'email'.
  - `AND provided_email_address = FALSE`: Further filters the results to include only records where an email address was not provided (`provided_email_address` is FALSE).
